# Welcome to XAISuite CLI! The world's first machine learning CLI.

This is the CLI for XAISuite. Check out github.com/11301858/XAISuite for the mother project.

To install, simply type 

```
brew tap 11301858/tap

brew install xai

```

For Mac, type in terminal

```
xaisuitecli -h

```
and otherwise type 

```
xai -h

```

and you should be ready to go. 

A previous version of XAISuiteCLI, xaisuitecli-legacy, is implemented using shell script and python. That program still works. The new and updated XAISuite CLI, however, is fully coded in Go and offers more options to the user.
