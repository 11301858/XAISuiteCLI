# Welcome to XAISuite CLI!

This is the CLI for XAISuite. Check out github.com/11301858/XAISuite for the mother project.

To install, simply type 

```
brew tap 11301858/tap

brew install xai

```

If you are on a Mac, you may need to add `/usr/local/Cellar/xai/2.0.4/bin` to path. 

Then, in terminal, type:

```
xaisuitecli -h

```
and you should be ready to go. 

A previous version of XAISuiteCLI, xaisuitecli-legacy, is implemented using shell script and python. That program still works. The new and updated XAISuite CLI, however, is fully coded in Go and offers more options to the user.
